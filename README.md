#### From Spec:
• Each branch maintains a queue of all existing cars and car types.
• The car rental agency maintains a list of all its customers
• Reservation can be done at any branch. Each customer can rent a car and return
it to the same branch or any other branch in Canada for an additional fee.
• If a car is returned to another branch, it will be included in the returned branch
queue of available cars.
• Car rental can be done on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Each rental category has
its own pricing based on the car type.
• If a customer has a Gold star membership with the rental agency, they will be eligible for
free upgrades if the car type selected is not available. Returning cars to different branches
will be free of charge for gold membership customers.
• Gold membership is granted automatically if a user rent at least three times in the same year.
• A late fee is applied if a customer returns a car later than the reservation return date.


#### Notes and Guidelines
##### UI
  - The UI must remain consistent. Currently it's set at a minimal UI, smaller sized fonts, no clutter. This was done to normalize the UI, and can be temporary.
  - We can vote on the direction we want to take the design, but it must remain consistent between screens.

##### Development
  - Documentation is necessary. Explain what each function does, and its place in the program. No need to go overboard, but give enough so we don't have to dig around to figure out why a function/button is there.
  - Descriptive variable names are necessary, e.g. no functions or variables named '`f`' with no notes on what they are or what they do.
  - Tasks will be assigned/announced so every team member knows what to do and they their teammates are doing.
